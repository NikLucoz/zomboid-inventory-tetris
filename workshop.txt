description=[h1]FAQ[/h1]
description=[h3]Why BETA?[/h3]
description=The mod is mostly complete and very stable, however, it still needs some polish here and there. Further, the mod was a huge undertaking and it will inevitably need some additional balancing and tweaks in response to player feedback.
description=
description=[h3]Multiplayer Support?[/h3]
description=The mod works fine in multiplayer from my testing. As usual, report any bugs you encounter and I'll fix them ASAP.
description=
description=[h3]How do items from other mods works?[/h3]
description=Inventory Tetris automatically examines items from other mods and determines what size they should be.
