TODO:
	A Full Equipment UI:
		Hotbar slots will also be shown, hotbarred items will also be removed from the grid, saving even more inventory space.

	UI for stack splitting

	Dev tool for updating grids
	Update item dev tool to allow setting stack limit
	Suppress aiming while mouse is over popups

	Container item type resitrctions
	Hueristic for stack limits for mod support reasons

	Search system:
		(Sandbox Setting)
		When enabled, players will need to search a container to see the items inside of it.
		Traits previously used for item transfer speed will affect search speed.
		Maybe tie this to a skill? *Not sure yet

	Better item distribution in 

	Sync mod data

	Mod Options integration



Post-Launch
	Furniture Loot-Bags:
		Allow any furniture item to be dropped

	MP Testing and bug fixing:
		I expect I'll see some container desync in the grids that I'll need to iron out.
		I do not expect any item desync though, so at worst players will be seeing the same items, but in different arrangements.

	Mod Option:
		Transfer Speed Options:
			By default, this mod removes all inventory transfer time.
			Sandbox options will be included to turn it back on. This can slow down using the inventory quite a bit though.
