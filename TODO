Scaling support




TODO:
	Ability to place items inside containers by dropping an item directly onto the container's icon on the grid.
	Support for stacking small items (Nails, ammo, money, etc) 

	A Full Equipment UI:
		So that equipped items can be removed from the inventory grid and not take space.
		This UI will show all the items currently equipped on your character as well as the empty slots you can drag-n-drop items onto.
			Zomboid has support for TONS of equipment slots, still not sure how this will have to be done...
		Hotbar slots will also be shown, hotbarred items will also be removed from the grid, saving even more inventory space.

	Manually adjusting item and backpack sizes
		(What you see now is a best guess. Any items I don't manually set the size of (i.e. items from other mods), will use this system.)

	Search system:
		(Sandbox Setting)
		When enabled, players will need to search a container to see the items inside of it.
		Traits previously used for item transfer speed will affect search speed.
		Maybe tie this to a skill? *Not sure yet

	Transfer Speed Options:
		By default, this mod removes all inventory transfer time.
		Sandbox options will be included to turn it back on. This can slow down using the inventory quite a bit though.

	MP Testing and bug fixing:
		I expect I'll see some container desync in the grids that I'll need to iron out.
		I do not expect any item desync though, so at worst players will be seeing the same items, but in different arrangements.
