DONE:
	Fix the grid
		* Stacking addtion shattered the grid's reliability
		Rework it to store data in the inventory/object mod data
		Rebuild completely every refresh, less bug potential this way and more self correction		

	Display all equipped inventories in a scroll view instead of 1 at a time.
		Occlude and skip rendering if out of view
		Remove sidebar?
		Display weight
		Fix "canAdd" logic, currently tied to the sidebar selected container

	Allow drag and drop out of inventory panel
	Start drag on container icons
	Fix ctrl click stacking
	Organization implementation for container/bags

	Better item distribution in fresh containers, make it look more interesting by spreading items around the grid corners

TODO:
	Fix building from hands/bags
	Speed up force equipping
	Prevent the collection of an undroppable (VIA buildmode picup) if no space is available and 2 undroppables are already present to occupy the hands

	UI for stack splitting
	Handle auto positioning better

	Item Equivelance system
		i.e. Water bottle <-> empty bottle
			auto keep position and force same size
	
	Hueristic for stack limits
		Automatically determine the max stack size of items using item data
		Automatic mod support!
			Also need to support manual overrides so anything can be fine tuned

		Default to not stacking

		Bullets stack to 60
			Override shotgun shells to 15

		Allow light junk to stack to 3
		Allow oven sheets to stack
		Ripped cloth to 3
		Cigs to 20

	Dev tool for updating grids
	Update item dev tool to allow setting stack limit
	
	Container item type resitrctions
		i.e. Medkits can only hold medical items
	
	Improve auto container sizes again
		Its getting decent

	Auto expand world grids for too many items???
		Red unusable slots by the player



	Mod Options integration

	SOUND
		Record and implement basic interaction sounds, sounds will be per item category


	Modding APIs
		Allow easy changes to data config
			Change item data
			New item data
			New grid data


Low Priority Or Post Launch
	Search system:
		(Sandbox Setting)
		When enabled, players will need to search a container to see the items inside of it.
		Traits previously used for item transfer speed will affect search speed.
		Maybe tie this to a skill? 
			*Not sure yet

	Suppress aiming while mouse is over popups
		This one is proving tough for the CTRL key, I can't figure out how the inventory windows are doing it.
			Not a huge problem, but I'd like to fix this

	MP Testing and bug fixing:
		I expect I'll see some container desync in the grids that I'll need to iron out.
		I do not expect any item desync though, so at worst players will be seeing the same items, but in different arrangements in the item grids.
		Sync mod data




Post-Launch
	Mod Option:
		Transfer Speed Options:
			By default, this mod removes all inventory transfer time.
				The time you spend managing the grid "replaces" it
			Sandbox options will be included to turn it back on. This can slow down using the inventory quite a bit though.

	SOUND
		Sound overrides for specific "popular" items
	
	Furniture Loot-Bags:
		Create a fake bag that weighs 999999999lbs on the ground when the player tries to drop an undroppable furniture item.
			Not all furniture can be dropped as an item, some MUST be placed/built
			This is a big problem with the new grid system
				(Is there a reason other than lack of textures that this can't be done by default?)
		
		This will allow the player to drop any piece furniture on the ground if they somehow end up in illegal item situation involving furniture.
			i.e. if you are carrying a table in your hands, but an action forces different items into your hands and the table has no where valid to go in your inventory.
