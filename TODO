TODO:
	A Full Equipment UI:
		So that equipped items can be removed from the inventory grid and not take space.
		This UI will show all the items currently equipped on your character as well as the empty slots you can drag-n-drop items onto.
			Zomboid has support for TONS of equipment slots, still not sure how this will have to be done...
		Hotbar slots will also be shown, hotbarred items will also be removed from the grid, saving even more inventory space.

	UI for stack splitting

	Dev tool for updating grids
	Update item dev tool to allow setting stack limit
	Suppress aiming while mouse is over popups

	Container item type resitrctions
	Hueristic for stack limits for mod support reasons

	On-Deck:
		Need a concept to allow the player to pickup something off the ground, even if they lack space, as long as they plan
		on using it immediately.
		Only 1 item should be able to be in this state
		If the action that would use it is interuppted the item is force dropped


	Search system:
		(Sandbox Setting)
		When enabled, players will need to search a container to see the items inside of it.
		Traits previously used for item transfer speed will affect search speed.
		Maybe tie this to a skill? *Not sure yet

	Transfer Speed Options:
		By default, this mod removes all inventory transfer time.
		Sandbox options will be included to turn it back on. This can slow down using the inventory quite a bit though.

	MP Testing and bug fixing:
		I expect I'll see some container desync in the grids that I'll need to iron out.
		I do not expect any item desync though, so at worst players will be seeing the same items, but in different arrangements.

	Mod Options integration
